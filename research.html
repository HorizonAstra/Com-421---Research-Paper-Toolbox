<h1>Realistic Research: University, Web-based, and Local Resources</h1>
<p>This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. in Technical Communication program who want to develop, improve, or refresh their research skills. Additionally, this lesson is designed to give students strategies which will help them research more efficiently.</p>

<h2>Content Areas</h2>
<p>This lesson will help you learn to acquire research resources through a review of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Getting Started</li>
    <li>Research Timelines</li>
    <li>Requesting Resources</li>
    <li>Local Libraries</li>
    <li>Finding Resources on the Web</li>
</ul>
<p>After you read the above sections, you will be directed to a short quiz which will help you reflect on the strategies presented in this lesson.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
<p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>

<p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started.</p>

<h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
<p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.</p>

<p>[[[INSERT IMAGE ABOUT HERE research2.jpg]]]</p>
<p><strong>CAPTION:</strong> The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>

<p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>

<p>Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand navigation bar.</p>

<p>The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>

<h2>Research Timelines</h2>
<h3>Formulating a timeline</h3>
<p>It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>

<p><strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project < Remaining time before deadline</strong></p>

<h3>Let's unpack some of those terms</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? -or- How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?</li>
    <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</li>
    <li><strong>Time to integrate resource into your project:</strong> Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project? If your paper is already written, do you have enough time to restructure it to allow for discussion of this resource, or would it simply be better to indicate your awareness of the resource with an explanation that time constraints prevented you from including it?</li>
    <li><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How much time is left before you must turn in your project? Is your resource powerful enough to cause you to rethink your approach to your topic? If so, requesting an extension might be in order.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
    <p>Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research timeline.</p>
</div>

<h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
<p>Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.</p>

<p>Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases. She knows that she must decide whether it is worthwhile for her to request those resources or to move on and look for resources that are more easily available. To do this, she constructs a research timeline.</p>

<p>Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write down her timeline, but she decides to set reasonable goals and record them in her Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements of her project should be completed. She first concludes that she has started with plenty of time to request any resources that she needs to complete the project, and that she will have sufficient time to wait for resources to arrive, read them, and incorporate what she has learned into her paper before she must turn in her final copy. She decides to read these articles when they arrive, and then expand her research to cover her topic as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Determining the best way to obtain resources</h3>
<p>Even if you can obtain a resource, that doesn't mean you necessarily should spend your time doing so. Be sure to preview a resource by reading a book review or previewing the book on Google Books to make sure that it is valuable enough to obtain. If you have determined that it is feasible and worthwhile to obtain a resource within the timeline you have developed, you must next consider how to obtain that resource.</p>

<p>In general, the safest way to obtain resources is to physically obtain a copy yourself. However, that is often inconvenient, impractical, or unnecessary. In cases such as those, interlibrary loan or MyILL is your best option. However, interlibrary loan can take time. Consider these guidelines when requesting your resource through interlibrary loan or MyILL.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The stated turnaround time:</strong> Problems can and do occur in transmitting library materials. For safety's sake, ask yourself the following question: "If it were to take twice as long as the stated turnaround time on the website, would I still have enough time to utilize the research?" Consider all of the factors in the formula above. If not, seek an alternative to interlibrary loan or MyILL.</li>
    <li><strong>The proximity of the lending library to your location:</strong> In the case of MyILL, articles are delivered exclusively online. However, if you are using WorldCat, your lending library may be located in Wisconsin, or it may be located in Canada, or Bulgaria, or Hong Kong. While chapters might be sent electronically, it takes time for books to be delivered from WorldCat libraries. Check the location of the lending library and take it into consideration when requesting materials from WorldCat.</li>
    <li><strong>The possibility that your materials may not arrive before your deadline:</strong> Can you complete your project without these materials? If you are still in the planning or topic selection phase, check for these materials and consider whether you will have enough time to utilize them in your project. If not, it would be wise to consider an alternative topic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
<h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine, as is the case in the figure below:</p>

<p>[[[INSERT IMAGE HERE research3.jpg]]]</p>

<p><strong>CAPTION:</strong> The "Request" option in Academic Search Premier.</p>

<p>As indicated in the image, you can click the "Request" option in the search results for that journal article. You will be directed to a new webpage which provides you with access to request an interlibrary loan for that article. You will have to provide some information about yourself. However, the page should pre-populate some of that information based on your Hawk Card login information.</p>

<p>When you fill out the form to request your article, be sure to double-check that you’ve entered your email address correctly so you will receive the article promptly!</p>

<h3>Requesting Books</h3>
<p>Requesting books can also be done through the "Request" option on the library website. However, you will likely have to fill out a form to request the book. You may need to allow for a longer turnaround time than is indicated for articles, since libraries need to physically send the books back and forth.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you are requesting an article or a book, make sure that you have provided accurate information when filling out the request form. If you have any questions, check in with the librarian at your campus library for help.</p>

<h2>Local Libraries</h2>
<h3>Accessing Local Libraries</h3>
<p>Accessing your local libraries may also be an option for obtaining research resources. Often, your community library will allow you to borrow books through their services. Be sure to check their catalogs for books and articles that you might want to utilize.</p>

<h3>Knowing When to Utilize Local Libraries</h3>
<p>In some cases, local libraries can be preferable to interlibrary loans. Local libraries often have resources available to you immediately, which can save you time. However, when using local libraries, make sure to consider your timeline. If your community library is located far from your residence, you may still prefer to use interlibrary loans. If, however, you have a community library nearby, that may be the best way to obtain your resource quickly.</p>

<h2>Finding Resources on the Web</h2>
<h3>Reviewing Web-Based Research Tools</h3>
<p>There are many ways to find research materials on the web. Some are better than others, but this lesson will help you get started finding resources that might be useful. Start by using some of the search engines designed for research purposes, such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> This is a very popular option, but it doesn’t index all research journals. However, it’s a great place to start!</li>
    <li><strong>JSTOR:</strong> JSTOR provides access to many scholarly journals, as well as primary sources in a variety of fields. It’s an excellent option for researchers.</li>
    <li><strong>ProQuest:</strong> ProQuest is another excellent option for accessing a range of scholarly journals, as well as newspapers and magazines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, you can always ask your librarian for help accessing databases and journals if you feel overwhelmed. They are experts in the area!</p>

<h3>Resources and Links</h3>
<p>After reviewing the above sections, you will be directed to a quiz that will help you reflect on the strategies presented in this lesson. Here are a few links that you can access:</p>
