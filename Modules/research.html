            <!-- Formulating a Timeline Section -->
            <h3 id="formulate-timeline">1. Formulating a Timeline</h3>
            <p>It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt; Remaining time before deadline
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Let’s unpack some of those terms:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><span class="emphasis">Time to obtain resource:</span> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? Or, how long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Time to read resource:</span> How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Time to integrate resource into your project:</span> Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project? If your paper is already written, do you have enough time to restructure it to allow for discussion of this resource?</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Remaining time before deadline:</span> How much time is left before you must turn in your project? If the resource is powerful enough to cause you to rethink your approach to your topic, requesting an extension might be necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Sidebar Note for Realism -->
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
                <p>Don’t assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. It’s better to set realistic goals and avoid wasting precious time on resources you can’t fully utilize.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Case Study Section -->
            <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
            <p>Bridgette, a graduate student in Tech Comm, was assigned a literature review and research paper. She decided to research the development of technical communication as a field between the early 20th century and World War II.</p>
            
            <p>To start, Bridgette logged into myIIT and searched for articles using databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. She found pertinent articles but couldn't access them directly. To determine if it was worthwhile to request these, she constructed a research timeline.</p>
            
            <p>Bridgette set reasonable goals in her Google calendar to track when each part of her project should be completed. Starting with enough time, she planned to request, read, and integrate each resource well before her deadline.</p>
            
            <!-- Determining Best Way to Obtain Resources Section -->
            <h3 id="use-timeline">2. Determining the Best Way to Obtain Resources</h3>
            <p>Even if you can obtain a resource, it’s essential to decide whether it’s worth the time. Preview resources through reviews or Google Books to ensure they’re valuable. If a resource fits within your timeline, consider these options:</p>
            
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><span class="emphasis">The stated turnaround time:</span> Consider whether you’d still have time to use the resource if it took twice the estimated time to arrive.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">The proximity of the lending library:</span> If you’re using WorldCat, your lending library could be far away, so delivery may take time. Always check the library’s location before requesting materials.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">The possibility of delay:</span> If the resource might not arrive in time, it’s better to select another topic or source that’s more accessible.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <!-- Requesting Resources Section -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
            
            <!-- Requesting Articles Subsection -->
            <h3 id="request-articles">1. Requesting Articles</h3>
            <p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine, as shown in the example below:</p>
            
            <!-- Placeholder for Article Request Example Image -->

            </figure>
            
            <p>Clicking on the <span class="emphasis">Get Article</span> link will direct you to a page like this, where you will either be able to retrieve the article through another website or where you will request the article through your <span class="emphasis">myILL account</span>.</p>
            
            <!-- Second Image Placeholder -->
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/research_article_request_2.jpg" alt="For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL">
                <figcaption>For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so you will need to register before you are able to request an article. Think of myILL as asking a friend to make a copy of an article for you. You will be notified by email when your article is ready to download, and you can log into myILL and view your page of delivered items.</p>
            
            <p>For more help requesting articles, see the <span class="emphasis">Library FAQ and How-to Pages</span>.</p>

            <!-- Requesting a Book From Another Library Subsection -->
            <h3 id="request-books">2. Requesting a Book from Another Library</h3>
            <p>When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT library system. If you are unsuccessful in finding the title you are looking for, next try to locate the book in <span class="emphasis">I-Share</span>. If I-Share yields no results, the next step is to search for your book in <span class="emphasis">WorldCat</span>.</p>
            
            <!-- Sidebar for Important Tip on Realistic Planning -->
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
                <p>When collecting resources, don’t assume that you will remember any of the titles you look up or that you will be able to find them again using past searches. Keep a list of resources on Google Documents or on your flash drive.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Reminder for Further Assistance -->
            <p>If you are confused when using any of the library systems, refer back to the <span class="emphasis">Library FAQ and How-to Pages</span>, which have tutorials explaining the step-by-step instructions for requesting resources.</p>

            <!-- Case Study Section -->
            <h3>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h3>
            <p>Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through them. One of the resources that Jane finds frequently quoted in academic papers is the 1923 text <em>English for Engineers</em> written by S. A. Harbarger. She decides that this is a valuable resource for her project and records the title, author, and year in her Google Docs resource list.</p>
            
            <p>After a quick search in I-Share, she finds it available at the University of Illinois library in Chicago. She makes a note of this in her resources list. Although Bridgette is working on another project, she knows she can return to her research notes and resume work when she’s ready.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Local Libraries Section -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
            <p>There are two types of local libraries that may contain your resources: other university libraries belonging to I-Share and public libraries.</p>
            
            <!-- I-Share Libraries Subsection -->
            <h3 id="access-local-libraries">1. I-Share Libraries</h3>
            <p>Many I-Share libraries allow you to pull books directly from the shelf and check them out if you present your IIT ID card and have no holds on your library account. Daley Library at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has an open stacks policy. UIC is also a Research I institution, so their library is quite extensive.</p>
            
            <p>However, not all area libraries participate in the I-Share system. For example, Loyola University and the University of Chicago do not participate in I-Share. You may be able to check out books, but under certain conditions, and you may not have access to browse their collections.</p>
            
            <p>If you plan to visit an I-Share library to obtain a resource, consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Where is the library located?</span> Will you need to travel outside of Chicago? If so, consider using interlibrary loan.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Can you enter the library?</span> Although you’re a student at an I-Share institution, different libraries have varying rules for who can browse book stacks.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">What are the library hours?</span> Not every institution uses the semester system. For instance, DePaul University uses the quarter system, so check their website to verify library hours.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Sidebar for Important Note -->
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
                <p>Don't waste your research time by traveling to a library only to find it closed or that browsing is restricted. When in doubt, call first.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Public Libraries Subsection -->
            <h3>2. Public Libraries</h3>
            <p>The Chicago Public Library (CPL) system is extensive and includes many books in high demand or hard to find at I-Share libraries, such as textbooks. If you live outside of Chicago, you cannot check out books, but you can visit and read or copy them. Most local libraries have similar policies. To obtain a CPL card, visit a CPL location with proof of residency.</p>
            
            <!-- Case Study Section -->
            <h3>Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from an I-Share Library</h3>
            <p>After finishing another project, Bridgette returns to her research paper on Tech Comm prior to World War II. She notices she had made a note to obtain <em>English for Engineers</em> by S. A. Harbarger, but now only has ten days left to finish her paper. Bridgette reassesses her research timeline and decides she has enough time to read, analyze, and incorporate this resource, but she needs to obtain it immediately.</p>
            
            <p>Seeing her note that the book is available at the UIC library, Bridgette gathers the title, author, local library, and call number and prepares to visit. Before she leaves, however, she checks the UIC library's hours and policies to avoid a wasted trip.</p>
            
            <!-- Local Library vs. Interlibrary Loan Section -->
            <h3 id="when-to-use-local">When to Use Local Library Resources Instead of Interlibrary Loan</h3>
            <p>There are two situations where you should consider obtaining a resource from a local library rather than through interlibrary loan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You no longer have enough time to wait for an interlibrary loan book to arrive.</li>
                <li>The book is unavailable through interlibrary loan.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Remember that CPL volumes are not listed in I-Share holdings. Even though public libraries are located in Illinois, they are not part of the I-Share system. You must search on the CPL website to view available titles.</p>
            
            <p>In the final section of this lesson, we'll explore the best way to obtain resources: the internet.</p>

            <p>If you can obtain the same resource online, why request it? Some resources available online include:</p>
            
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><span class="emphasis">Public domain writings:</span> Accessible without any cost or restriction.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Resources licensed under Creative Commons:</span> Often freely available for educational use.</li>

            <h3>2. Using Web Resources for Research</h3>
            <p>These web resources can help you find additional resources:</p>
            
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><span class="emphasis">Google Scholar:</span> Allows you to search for scholarly articles and view which articles are cited by other articles.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Google Books:</span> Allows you to preview a book, or in some cases, view the entire book, including the references section.</li>
                <li><span class="emphasis">Web of Science:</span> Similar to Google Scholar, but focused on scientific papers.</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
                <p>If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your topic. These collections provide a snapshot of collective scholarship on a topic, helping you see how your topic relates to other research.</p>

            <!-- Case Study Section -->
            <h3>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h3>
            <p>Near the end of her project, Bridgette questions some arguments in a central article in her paper, "<em>The Rise of Technical Writing Instruction in America</em>" by R.J. Connors (1982). She wants to see if other researchers included examples of technical writing instruction before World War II. Assuming many articles would have referenced Connors' work, she searches Google Scholar using his article title and finds it has been cited 62 times. From there, she reviews articles that cite Connors to find examples relevant to her research.</p>
