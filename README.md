# Com-421---Research-Paper-Toolbox

*Sustainable information structure project*
*COM 421 (Fall 2024)*


Overview:

I’m giving you the contents of a website that I wrote and designed with collaborators severalyears ago: The Research Paper Toolbox. The site was originally to serve as a resource for incoming graduate students. Although we did our best to create a unified information structure for the site it was a “design by committee” project with a limited timeframe to develop a final version, so it has several inconsistencies and limited ability to sustainably expand or modify content in the future.

The overall instructional design architecture is a module-based learning environment with self-assessments at the end of each module. I’ve preserved that module structure, but that is all the information structure information I will give you. You’ll infer the rest from the stylistic cues in the document that imply the semantic relationship between elements and execute your markup based on the following principles:

1. The document should conform to the W3C Specifications on valid HTML5 and should pass validation;
2. The site should be extensible to accommodate additional modules as they becomeavailable, meaning you should provide a template for the inclusion of a new module that anyone with your level of familiarity with HTML5 can successfully develop into a
fully-formed module;
3. The stylistic choices, while not elaborate, should use CSS to present the information in a coherent structure that a user can follow as they engage in self-directed learning (HTML navigation should support this feature, both within modules and in a top-level navigation
that makes it easy for users to progress through the course).
4. The final site should have file names and directory structures that an outsider could reasonably understand if they inherited the project.
