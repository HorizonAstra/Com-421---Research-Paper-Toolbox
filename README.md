# Research Paper Toolbox

## Overview

The Research Paper Toolbox website was developed as a resource for incoming graduate students, focusing on guiding students through the research and writing process. Originally designed collaboratively, the site required a unified structure to support self-directed learning. However, it was initially developed with constraints, including a short timeframe and limited expandability. This version is part of an assignment to improve its design consistency, structure, and sustainability.

This project includes:
1. **The Website**: A home page with top-level navigation and two fully structured modules.
2. **Template for Future Modules**: A standalone HTML page demonstrating structural elements and styling to help others easily add new modules.
3. **Self-Critique**: A reflection on design choices and potential improvements.

## Project Contents

- **Home Page**: Features a top-level navigation to access all modules.
- **Modules**: Two educational modules built with a cohesive structure for ease of self-directed learning.
- **Template**: A template for future modules that showcases the information structure and design consistency required for easy integration of new content.

## Project Structure and File Naming

The project follows a clear and consistent file and directory structure to allow future developers or collaborators to understand, maintain, and expand the content easily. Each HTML file is linked to a single CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling. Images and other resources are organized into logically named folders (`Images` and `CSS`) for straightforward navigation and management.
