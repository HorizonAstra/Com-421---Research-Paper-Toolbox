# Research Paper Toolbox

## Overview

The Research Paper Toolbox website was developed as a resource for incoming graduate students, focusing on guiding students through the research and writing process. Originally designed collaboratively, the site required a unified structure to support self-directed learning. However, it was initially developed with constraints, including a short timeframe and limited expandability. This version is part of an assignment to improve its design consistency, structure, and sustainability.

This project includes:
1. **The Website**: A home page with top-level navigation and two fully structured modules.
2. **Template for Future Modules**: A standalone HTML page demonstrating structural elements and styling to help others easily add new modules.
3. **Self-Critique**: A reflection on design choices and potential improvements.

## Project Contents

- **Home Page**: Features a top-level navigation to access all modules.
- **Modules**: Two educational modules built with a cohesive structure for ease of self-directed learning.
- **Template**: A template for future modules that showcases the information structure and design consistency required for easy integration of new content.

## Project Structure and File Naming

The project follows a clear and consistent file and directory structure to allow future developers or collaborators to understand, maintain, and expand the content easily. Each HTML file is linked to a single CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling. Images and other resources are organized into logically named folders (`Images` and `CSS`) for straightforward navigation and management.

## Self-Critique

For this project, my primary goal was to create a consistent, intuitive information structure to support self-directed learning. I focused on unifying the layout and navigation, ensuring that users could easily access resources and navigate through the modules. The top-level and internal navigation were designed for simplicity and clarity, with each module following a standardized structure to facilitate future expansion.

Given more time, I would enhance accessibility by conducting more comprehensive testing to optimize the site for screen readers and keyboard navigation. Adding interactivity, such as quizzes or multimedia elements, would also benefit users by catering to diverse learning styles and making the experience more engaging. Another improvement would be incorporating a dark mode or adjustable font sizes, allowing users to customize their viewing experience.

Overall, this project was about balancing functionality with ease of use, adhering closely to HTML and CSS standards, and avoiding aesthetic distractions. However, with additional resources, I’d prioritize deeper customization and accessibility to ensure the Research Paper Toolbox is inclusive and adaptable to all users.
